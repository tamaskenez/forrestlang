Forrest, the new computer language

*Forrest* is a good name because this language is supposed to be simple yet much more effective than the sophisticated solutions.

- Define a hard-to-read intermediate language first which describes the semantics. Final, front-end syntax is for later.
- Final syntax could be along the lines of breuleux's thoughts about a less strict LISP-like syntax so we can construct AST without using semantic information.
